# Speed Hating Deluxe

This is a more polished and optimised version of Speed Hating. It has a lot of experimental features and things are mostly subject to change with complete revamps. 

## About

Speed Hating Deluxe is a social game built on React with Playroomkit. It simulates the venomous parts of internet conversations; online arguments. It is a satire game where you're rewarded for throwing insults better than your opponent's at them. A silly and comedic attempt.

## How to run the game

The process is fairly simple. Here are the steps:

 1. Pull the Github repository to your system.
 2. Now you need to install the npm dependencies. Simply type the following command in your terminal:
    ```
    npm i
    ```
 3. Finally, to run the game type:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
